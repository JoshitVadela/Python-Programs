# Python-Programs
Welcome to my Python Programs repository! üêçüíª  
This is for all of the Python Programs

## Introduction
This repository houses a collection of various Python programs that I've developed. Distinct from projects, these programs focus on specific functionalities, algorithms, and solutions to tackle different coding challenges. As a Grade 9 student deeply passionate about Python, programming, and computer science, this repository reflects my commitment to continuous learning and coding exploration.

## What You'll Find Here
Inside this repository, you'll discover an assortment of Python programs covering a wide spectrum of functionalities and problem-solving techniques, including but not limited to:

* Specific algorithms and data structures implemented in Python
* Code snippets solving particular problems or demonstrating concepts
* Programs illustrating Python's capabilities in various domains

## How to Explore
Each program is organized into dedicated folders or files, accompanied by brief explanations or comments describing their functionality and purpose. Feel free to delve into these programs to explore their workings and how they address specific challenges.

## Folder Structure
### Email_Sender-Program
* Email_Sender_Github.ipynb: Program developed to send an email to your mail based off of Python code

### Word_Replacement-Program
